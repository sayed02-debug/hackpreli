Team JnU_TrueNest Project - Voter API
Welcome to our Voter API project! This is a simple Flask-based application built for the Hackathon Preli by Team JnU_TrueNest. Itâ€™s designed to manage voter data with a clean API endpoint. Letâ€™s dive into what this project is all about!
Whatâ€™s Inside:

app.py: The main Flask app with the voter API logic.
Dockerfile: Sets up the Python environment in a Docker container.
docker-compose.yml: Configures the Docker service to run the app.
requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies (like Flask).

How to Run
Weâ€™ve made it easy to get started with Docker! Hereâ€™s what to do:

Install Docker: Make sure Docker Desktop is installed on your machine.
Clone or Use the ZIP: Get the project files (either clone the repo or use the jnu_truenest.zip).
Navigate to the Folder: Open your terminal and go to the project directory (e.g., cd C:\team_jnu).
Start the App:docker compose up -d --build


Test the API: Open your browser or use a tool like PowerShell:$body = @{ voter_id = 4; name = "David"; age = 20 } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/voters" -Method Post -Headers @{"Content-Type"="application/json"} -Body $body

You should see a response with the voter data!

API Endpoint

POST /api/voters: Add a new voter.
Body: { "voter_id": int, "name": string, "age": int }
Response: Voter object with has_voted set to False by default.



Notes

The app runs on port 8000.
Weâ€™ve used Python 3.9 in the Docker imageâ€”keep that in mind if you tweak things!
Feel free to reach out if you hit any snagsâ€”weâ€™re happy to help!

Thanks!
